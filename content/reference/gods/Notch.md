## Real Life

In the actual human world, **Markus "Notch" Persson** is known as the **"Creator of Minecraft"**. He started creating the game somewhere around 2009 (it was made to the public in May of 2009, but it isn't sure exactly when he started it), and fully released Minecraft in November of 2011.

## Role
As the first god, Notch was responsible for the creation of Minecraft. In the early days, he requested for a companion, and the Command Block complied, giving him another god by the name of **_Jeb**. Together, they created the rest of the known Minecraft up to 5 ACM, where **Microsoft** bought the company.
